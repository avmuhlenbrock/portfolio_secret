In order construct this principle, we focused on digital simulation studies based on a grid information system where the cubic form enable us to perform the trajectory freedom of understanding multi directional networks of reproduction. Constructed by the controlled system of a universal unit formed by a 3 by 3, 27 voxel organism, where each voxel posses the multi materiality condition with the capacity to direct graduated strategies of actuation in a expanded, contracted, rigid or neutral combination of states, give us the possibility to attempt a dynamic system that can respond to changes through self-awareness, mobility and softness where every unit could reconfigure themselves in order to transform into a determined structure.",

Reminding the attention from Paul Ricoeur by asking; How to become modern and return to the sources, how to revive an old and dormant civilisation and take part in the universal civilisation? The intent of this project is to rescue a previous element of our historical past that has been prevailing institutionally in the Chilean idiosyncrasy, which is the Jesuit Mission. From this premise, it is proposed a Jesuit mission as a design practice, articulator place for an historical present for the reunion and meeting space of an ancient religious order [Jesuits of Chile] and our old present forgotten [Mapuche] civilisation. Realizing so, it was taken the Jesuit-indigenous spatial layout for actual architecture program. The Jesuit mission intends to create an architecture that lives between two worlds and be a unifying impact on the Chilean territory of Tirúa; one of the poorest and most troubled indigenous communities concentrated in the country. A work experience with a representative material reflecting with the indigenous world [Wood] and their spiritual connection to the land [plane-horizontal concept of spirituality] versus the western world  [Concrete] in a particular and spiritual connection with God in heaven [plane-vertical spirituality], as well as in his programmatic function into linear progress of peregrination... the [living in the east] to the [perish of the west into Mocha island], being assembled in a central square as neutral meeting place.",

This project was designed by Stephen Spyropoulos and Theodore Spyropoulos. It is an installation that consists of a main structure, positioned in the center of a stationary ground, where it is controlled and regulated according to the situation of a number of semi-autonomous sphere-bots. The sphere-bots are wandering around the main structure and interacts between themselves and with the visitors who are able to affect and contribute to the whole system. Each sphere-bot contains a signal device that according to the behavior and his variable set of emotions that he is experiencing, sends a particular message through a wire-less digital camera that is hanged in the upper part of the installation. The camera who is constantly detecting and capturing each emotion from the sphere-bots, returns the «emotive signal» into the main center structure, where from there, affects the aesthetic representation of the model. The representation turns into an «animated strategy» and beautiful composition of colors [white, yellow, red, blue] that somehow evoke a new kind of regulation within the whole system."]

The building was supposed to fit different types of apartments, specifically some of 50m2, 80m2 and 120m2. The project introduces the idea of two separate facades, that respond according to the strong and weak sun lights of the day in that particular area. The one who  faces the east side is completely covered by thick glass, while the other facade confronts the west side where the light is quite strong after 4pm.
